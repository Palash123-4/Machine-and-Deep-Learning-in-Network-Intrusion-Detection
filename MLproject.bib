abstractNote = {The role of mathematics in a complex system such as the Internet has yet to be deeply explored. In this paper, we summarize some of the important and pressing problems in cyber security from the viewpoint of open science environments. We start by posing the question 'What fundamental problems exist within cyber security research that can be helped by advanced mathematics and statistics'? Our first and most important assumption is that access to real-world data is necessary to understand large and complex systems like the Internet. Our second assumption is that many proposed cyber security solutions could critically damage both the openness and the productivity of scientific research. After examining a range of cyber security problems, we come to the conclusion that the field of cyber security poses a rich set of new and exciting research opportunities for the mathematical and statistical sciences.},

abstract = {With the increasing amount of network throughput and security threat, the study of intrusion detection systems (IDSs) has received a lot of attention throughout the computer science field. Current IDSs pose challenges on not only capricious intrusion categories, but also huge computational power. Though there is a number of existing literatures to IDS issues, we attempt to give a more elaborate image for a comprehensive review. Through the extensive survey and sophisticated organization, we propose the taxonomy to outline modern IDSs. In addition, tables and figures we summarized in the content contribute to easily grasp the overall picture of IDSs.}

abstract = {The popularization of shared networks and Internet usage demands increases attention on information system security, particularly on intrusion detection. Two data mining methodologies—Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) and two encoding methods—simple frequency-based scheme and tf×idf scheme are used to detect potential system intrusions in this study. Our results show that SVM with tf×idf scheme achieved the best performance, while ANN with simple frequency-based scheme achieved the worst. The data used in experiments are BSM audit data from the DARPA 1998 Intrusion Detection Evaluation Program at MIT's Lincoln Labs.}

abstract="Due to increase in intrusion activities over internet, many intrusion detection systems are proposed to detect abnormal activities, but most of these detection systems suffer a common problem which is producing a high number of alerts and a huge number of false positives. As a result, normal activities could be classified as intrusion activities. This paper examines different data mining techniques that could minimize both the number of false negatives and false positives. C5 classifier's effectiveness is examined and compared with other classifiers. Results should that false negatives are reduced and intrusion detection has been improved significantly. A consequence of minimizing the false positives has resulted in reduction in the amount of the false alerts as well. In this study, multiple classifiers have been compared with C5 decision tree classifier using NSL{\_}KDD dataset and results have shown that C5 has achieved high accuracy and low false alarms as an intrusion detection system.",
