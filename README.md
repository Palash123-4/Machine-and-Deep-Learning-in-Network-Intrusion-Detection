# Machine-and-Deep-Learning-in-Network-Intrusion-Detection
**Abstract:** In the subject of cybersecurity, Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection
Systems(AIDS) is a vital and rapidly evolving study area developed
to identify different kinds of malicious network traffic and computer
usage, which cannot be identified by traditional farewell. In this
project, a comparison analysis has been conducted on some popular machine
learning and deep learning techniques-based anomaly detectors on
a dataset which consists of a wide range of intrusions replicated in a
military network environment.
The detailed method with python implementation has been provided in **ML_project.ipynb**.
